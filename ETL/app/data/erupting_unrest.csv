The volcano is located at the junction of the Izu-Marianas and NE Japan volcanic arcs. The modern Maekake cone forms the summit and is situated east of the remnant of an older andesitic volcano, Kurofuyama, which was destroyed by a late-Pleistocene landslide about 20,000 years before present (BP). Growth of a dacitic shield volcano was accompanied by pumiceous pyroclastic flows, the largest of which occurred about 14,000-11,000 BP, and by growth of the Ko-Asamayama lava dome on the east flank. Maekake, capped by the Kamayama pyroclastic cone that forms the present summit, is probably only a few thousand years old and has observed activity dating back at least to the 11th century CE. Maekake has had several major Plinian eruptions, the last two of which occurred in 1108 (Asamayama's largest Holocene eruption) and 1783 CE.",36.406,138.523,2568,Subduction zone / Continental crust (> 25 km),Holocene,Eruption Observed,https://volcano.si.edu/gallery/photos/GVP-01465.jpg,"The Onioshidashi lava flow on the N flank of Asamayama volcano was erupted at the end of the last major eruption in 1783.

The andesitic-to-dacitic volcano was formed in three eruptive stages beginning in the early to mid-Pleistocene. The Pleistocene Oshi pyroclastic flow produced extensive welded tuffs and non-welded pumice that covers much of the E, S, and SW flanks. The latest eruptive stage began about 14,000 years ago. Historical eruptions have consisted of phreatic explosions from the acidic crater lakes or their margins. Fumaroles and hot springs that dot the flanks have strongly acidified many rivers draining from the volcano. The crater was the site of active sulfur mining for many years during the 19th and 20th centuries.",36.618,138.528,2165,Subduction zone / Continental crust (> 25 km),Holocene,Eruption Observed,https://volcano.si.edu/gallery/photos/GVP-01496.jpg,"The summit of Kusatsu-Shiranesan contains three craters with the largest, Yugama, holding the turquoise lake shown here. Rafts of yellow sulfur float on the surface of the acidic lake. This 1977 view looks across the lake from the SW-most crater (Karagama) to the NE-most crater (Mizugama), located beyond the notch to the left. Small-to-moderate phreatic explosions have been recorded from all three craters since the 1800s.","Photo by Lee Siebert, 1977 (Smithsonian Institution).",Andesite / Basaltic Andesite,138.528,36.618,2025-11-24,unrest,15
