Huge boulders landed on Vordufell in Skeid, and a man was killed by a falling stone in front of the main entrance at Skalholt"".  This is actually located about 40 km distance. However, more recent reference - Thorarinsson 1967 states that the man was killed during evacuation in Landsveit, and that the man in Skalholt was stunned. Although rocks are said to have falled at Vordufell, Gudrun Larsen via Evgenia Ilyinskaya (pers. comm) explains that pre-existing rocks are often noticed and reported during eruptions as freshly fallen. They also explain that the fatality described at 20 km could have occurred within that distance, as he was just described as 'on the run' from the eruption, with no precise location except that he was not far from the main axis of tephra fall direction. Thorarinsson's description of 'East in the country' is an incorrect translation from Icelandic, and in fact refers to Landssveit, south-east of Hekla.
